At Bharatiya Yuva Sangha, we believe that real change doesn’t always begin in boardrooms or government halls—it begins at the grassroots, in the hands of young, passionate individuals. Our journey started with a simple idea: to inspire youth to take charge of their surroundings and lead the movement for a cleaner, greener India.

From our very first cleanliness drive in the rural village of Kawripathar to our workshops in local schools, we've witnessed a powerful transformation. Young volunteers, many of them students, have not only cleaned their communities but also sparked awareness in others. These efforts have turned passive citizens into active participants.

Through tree plantation campaigns, school outreach, and social media advocacy, we've created platforms for youth to act, lead, and inspire. Our goal is not just to clean, but to build a culture of environmental responsibility and civic pride.

This blog shares our experiences, lessons, and voices from the field—capturing stories of impact that prove youth are not just the leaders of tomorrow, but the changemakers of today. Join us as we continue to move from one village to the next, carrying the message: *“Clean India starts with me.”*
